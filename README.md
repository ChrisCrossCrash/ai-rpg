# AI RPG

The goal of this project is to make an RPG featuring NPCs with LLM-generated dialog, rather than pre-scripted dialog trees.

## Next Steps

**NPC Dialog**
- [ ] Prompt input: For now, just a way to fill and submit a prompt.
- [ ] AI API integration: The NPC responds to the prompt.

**World**
- [ ] Generate objects for placing on the level.
- [ ] Make it so that you can't walk through certain tiles by default.
